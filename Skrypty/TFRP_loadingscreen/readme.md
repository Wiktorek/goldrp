## Modifications

- I simply downloaded the loadingscreen from Github and i have made this changes:
    - Changed the logo
    - Added a music

## How To edit

- How to edit the logo, bg or music?
    - If you want to replace the logo just replace the file "logo.PNG" ##the new logo must have the same name
    - If you want to replace the BG just replace the "background" file ##The background file must have the same name
    - If you want to replace the Music just replace the file "Loading.ogg" in "music" folder

    !! Note !!

    The name and extensions of all file you replace must have the same name of the file replaced

    If you want to ear the music in the browser use FireFrox browser because google does not support the ogg file
